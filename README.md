# kentico-onboarding-js
Simple step-by-step task for Kentico Academy to learn basics of JS, React, Redux.

This project will consist of two tasks. In first one we will implement simple list of editable items using ReactJS only. In the second part we will try to refactor our code to use ImmutableJS and ReduxJS. 

The requirements for the resulting project are captured in assignment.git. Note that we will aim to make the sloution generic enough so that more items can be in 'edit' mode at once.

## How to run the project 
The project was created with [react-create-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) boilerplate. 
You should use WebStorm IDE to get familiar with it. Prerequisites for running this project are node v6+ and npm v3+. (If you followed the Draft onboarding on Kentico wiki pages, you should be ready to go.)
